# Pywr Training

This repository contains public releases of training material for the Pywr water resource model (https://github.com/pywr/pywr). Please download the latest release from the releases page.

The material is divided into two courses, beginner and advanced. The beginner course is aimed at people who are new to Pywr. It does not assume any prior knowledge of Pywr, though some familiarity with Python would be beneficial. The advanced course is aimed at people who have already used Pywr and have have at least a basic familiarity with Python

Each course contains a series of modules. Each module is a self-contained unit that covers a specific topic or set of topics. The modules are designed to be delivered in a workshop format. Each module contains a series of slides and in most cases a set of exercises in a Jupyter notebook.
